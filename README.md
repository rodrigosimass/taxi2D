# taxi2D
Path planning for a **Taxi** agent on a **2D** grid using Markov Decision Processes.

## Description
We model the 2D Grid of the taxi as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in a fully observable environment.
The state is represented by the position of the Taxi, and whether or not he has picked up/dropped off the passenger yet.
With a sufficiently large simulation, the program will learn the optimal policy for this problem.

## Getting Started
This is a simple python notebook. Run the cells sequentially and see the results.
### Dependencies

* Requires Python3.
* Requires the numpy library which can be installed with pip.
